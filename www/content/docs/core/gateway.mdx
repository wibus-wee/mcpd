title: Gateway
description: One MCP endpoint, many servers.

The gateway is the only MCP endpoint your clients need. It looks like a single MCP server, but it routes requests to your real servers through the core. This keeps client configuration simple even when your catalog grows.

## Routing by path or header
Clients select a target server or tag group by appending a selector to the base path, or by sending a header. Path routing is the recommended default because most MCP clients expect a distinct endpoint per server.

**Path selectors**
- `/mcp/server/{name}`
- `/mcp/tags/{tag1,tag2}`

**Header selectors**
- `X-Mcp-Server: name`
- `X-Mcp-Tags: tag1,tag2`

## Why the gateway exists
The gateway isolates clients from your internal topology. You can add or remove servers, change lifecycle settings, or adjust tags without touching client configuration.

## How to start it

```bash
go run ./cmd/mcpvmcp --transport streamable-http
```

Then connect a client using a selector path like:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8090/mcp/server/weather`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8090/mcp/tags/chat,tools`

If the gateway can list tools on those endpoints, routing is working.
